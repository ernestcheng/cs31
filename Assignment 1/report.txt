Step 5Using input where numKeep = numRefund:Input:How many diesel Volkswagen owners were surveyed? 10How many of them say they will take a payment and keep their car? 5How many of them say they will return their car for a refund? 5Output50.0% say they will keep their car.50.0% say they will demand a refund.More people will demand a refund than keep their car.Program ended with exit code: 0Explanation: When numKeep = numRefund, the function will output “More people will demand a refund than keep their car.” This is incorrect as the two variables and hence the two percentage variables (pctKeep and pctRefund) are equal. The reason for this incorrect answer is because of the if…else… statement in Line 31-33. When numKeep = numRefund, the if statement is false and therefore skips straight to the else statement.Using input where numberSurveyed is very high:Input:How many diesel Volkswagen owners were surveyed? 1000000000000How many of them say they will take a payment and keep their car? How many of them say they will return their car for a refund? Output:0.0% say they will keep their car.74.8% say they will demand a refund.More people will demand a refund than keep their car.Program ended with exit code: 0Explanation:When the answer to the first question is extremely high, in this case one trillion (1000000000000), the function prints the second and third questions but does not allow for input. This might be because one trillion is larger than the maximum that can be held by a integer variable (~2.147 billion). It outputs that 0.0% will keep the car and 74.8% will demand a refund but this is nonsensical.Step 6Original Line 21:     double pctRefund = 100.0 * numRefund / numberSurveyed;New Line 21:     double pctRefund = 100.0 * numberSurveyed / numRefund;Input:How many diesel Volkswagen owners were surveyed? 10How many of them say they will take a payment and keep their car? 7How many of them say they will return their car for a refund? 3Output:70.0% say they will keep their car.333.3% say they will demand a refund.More people will keep their car than demand a refund.Program ended with exit code: 0Explanation: This logic error creates a calculation error where the percentage of owners asking for a refund is wrong. By switching around the variables numberSurveyed and numRefund, the function produces a percentage of 333.3% in this case which means it is operating incorrectly.Step 7Error 1Original Line 7: int main()New Line 7: int mainError Message: Expected '(' for function-style cast or type constructionExplanation: Forgetting to type the brackets when defining a function causes the compiler to not recognize main as a function.Error 2Original Line 21:     double pctRefund = 100.0 * numRefund / numberSurveyed;New Line 21:     double pctRefund = 100.0 * numRefund / numberSurveyedError Message: Expected ';' at end of declarationExplanation:The lack of the delimiter (;) between line 21 and 22 causes the compiler to not recognize it as two different lines / declarations. Error 1 interferes with the reporting of Error 2, as the compiler instead believes the code is lacking a delimiter at the end.
